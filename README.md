# Comma
A tool that I daily use at work to monitor devices(Routers,Switcges...etc) requires the devices' names to be entered separated by commas  
Requests to monitor multiple batches never come formated and devices are usually separated by either new lines or whitespace  
Comma solve's this issue and makes life easier for me.  
I hot bodged a niffty Python script during a 15 min break at work and gave it a simple ui  
Comma removes all new line characters and whitespace, seperates devices by commas and copies them to the clipboard
